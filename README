Welcome to the OpenSurgSim Project!

OpenSurgSim is a new (2013) effort to build an open-source surgical simulation
framework. The foundation of the framework draws on many years of proprietary
simulation development that has matured to the point of being generally useful
for a wide range of simulators. Over the course of the year, the released
framework will grow from the minimal infrastructure that is currently available
to a system capable of creating complete simulations. Although the initial core
is being contributed by SimQuest, the intent is that other groups join in the
effort to form an active community with contributions coming from a variety of
places.

For current information and documentation about the project, please

To help get started using OpenSurgSim, use the following quick start
guide.

    1. Getting OpenSurgSim
    2. Compiling on GNU/Linux
    3. Compiling on Windows
    4. Running the Examples
	Appendix: Dependencies


1. Getting OpenSurgSim
======================

OpenSurgSim uses Git for source control, and this is the easiest way
to obtain the most up to date version. Resources for installing and
using Git can be found on Git's website (See Appendix). To obtain
OpenSurgSim, run the following command:

    git clone git://git.assembla.com/OpenSurgSim.git 

This will download the source code for OpenSurgSim and place it in the
OpenSurgSim/ directory.


2. Compiling on GNU/Linux
=========================

OpenSurgSim has been tested extensively on Debian Testing (Jessie) as
well as Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). If you are using another GNU/Linux
distribution, please check your package management system for the
dependencies (see Appendix). For Debian/Ubuntu based systems, the
dependencies are easily installed through apt-get:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libopenscenegraph-dev
    sudo apt-get install cmake doxygen google-mock

To build OpenSurgSim, issue the following commands from the same
directory used to obtain OpenSurgSim (see Section 1.)

    mkdir OpenSurgSim/Build
    cd OpenSurgSim/Build
    cmake ../
    make

That's it!


3. Compiling on Windows 
=======================

OpenSurgSim installation and compilation instructions.

Compiler minimum requirement:
• Windows compiler requirement: Visual Studio 2012
• Linux compiler requirement:

OpenSurgSim source code (http://opensurgsim.org):
• Download it under the 'Git' tab.
• Also find under the 'Dashboard' tab a nightly build result which can be used
  to verify the current state of the build.

Cmake configuration:
• Create a folder where you want to generate the solution/make file.
  This folder is referred to as BUILD folder for the purpose of the following
  steps.
• Generate the OpenSurgSim solution file.
  Two ways to do this: using cmake gui or the cmake command line.
  ¤ Open CMake GUI: Enter the OpenSurgSim folder, BUILD folder and click on the
    'Configure' button. This will allow you to select the compiler (VS 11, even
    though you installed “Visual Studio 2012”).
    Once the configuration is complete without error, click on the 'Generate'
    button.
    If CMake reports “library not found”, add system variables BOOST_ROOT,
    EIGEN_DIR and OSG_ROOT as environment variables. Then add %OSG_ROOT%\bin to
    your Path variable.
  ¤ Using cmake command line: Create a cmake “cache” file with the following
    lines:
    + set(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR "path-to-eigen" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(BOOST_ROOT "path-to-boost" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(OSG_DIR "path-to-osg" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you want the solution
    files to be created, and type the following command:
    cmake -C path-to-cache-file path-to-oss-source-dir

Building OpenSurgSim:
• Go to the BUILD folder and open the OpenSurgSim solution file.
• Build the project called ALL_BUILD.
• For documentation, you can find it in your build directory:
  BUILD\Documentation\html\index.html
• For runnable code, see the Examples folder.

Welcome to the OpenSurgSim Project!
OpenSurgSim is a new (2013) effort to build an open-source surgical simulation
framework. The foundation of the framework draws on many years of proprietary
simulation development that has matured to the point of being generally useful
for a wide range of simulators. Over the course of the year, the released
framework will grow from the minimal infrastructure that is currently available
to a system capable of creating complete simulations. Although the initial core
is being contributed by SimQuest, the intent is that other groups join in the
effort to form an active community with contributions coming from a variety of
places.

OpenSurgSim installation and compilation instructions.

Compiler minimum requirement:
• Windows compiler requirement: Visual Studio 2012
• Linux compiler requirement:

OpenSurgSim source code can be downloaded at http://opensurgsim.org under the
  Git tab.

Cmake configuration:
• Create a folder where you want to generate the solution/make file.
  This folder is referred to as BUILD folder for the purpose of the following
  steps.
• Generate the OpenSurgSim solution file.
  Two ways to do this: using cmake gui or the cmake command line.
  ¤ Open CMake GUI: Enter the OpenSurgSim folder, BUILD folder and click on the
    'Configure' button. This will allow you to select the compiler (VS 11, even
    though you installed “Visual Studio 2012”).
    Once the configuration is complete without error, click on the 'Generate'
    button.
    If CMake reports “library not found”, add system variables BOOST_ROOT,
    EIGEN_DIR and OSG_ROOT as environment variables. Then add %OSG_ROOT%\bin to
    your Path variable.
  ¤ Using cmake command line: Create a cmake “cache” file with the following
    lines:
    + set(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR "path-to-eigen" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(BOOST_ROOT "path-to-boost" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(OSG_DIR "path-to-osg" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you want the solution
    files to be created, and type the following command:
    cmake -C path-to-cache-file path-to-oss-source-dir

Building OpenSurgSim:
• Go to the BUILD folder and open the OpenSurgSim solution file.
• Build the project called ALL_BUILD.
• For documentation, you can find it in your build directory:
  BUILD\Documentation\html\index.html
• For runnable code, see the Examples folder.

OpenSurgSim simulation framework
Copyright 2012-2013, SimQuest Solutions Inc.

Tools needed:
• Get CMake from http://www.cmake.org/ and install it.
• Install Git and any Git client you like to use.
• Windows compiler requirement: minimum Visual Studio 2012
• Linux compiler requirement:

OpenSurgSim source code:
• Download the OpenSurgSim source code by going to http://opensurgsim.org and
  clicking the Git tab.

Dependencies:
• Create an OSS folder to extract/install all the dependencies.
• Get Eigen library from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org (version 3.2.0 minimum) and
  extract it to the OSS folder.
• Get boost libraries from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ (version 1.54
  minimum) and extract to the OSS folder.
  For OpenSurgSim, we need to compile chrono, filesystem, date_time, and thread
  libraries in Boost.
  Please refer to http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/more/getting_started/
  for instructions on how to compile Boost for different platforms
• [OPTIONAL] For producing documentation, install Doxygen from www.doxygen.org
  or http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.8.4-setup.exe
• Install OpenSceneGraph
• [Optional] Install/setup GLUT:
  ¤ Windows with OSG/win64/lib contaning glut32.lib:
    If it is not automatically discovered by cmake, add the OSG/win64/include
    and OSG/win64/lib folders to your environment.
  ¤ Windows without OSG contaning glut:
    Windows 32 bits libraries are at http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
      or https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut_downloads.php
      Create the following folder structure:
      + GLUT/include/GL/glut.h
      + GLUT/Release/glut32.*
      Create an environment variable GLUT_ROOT_PATH pointing to GLUT.
    Windows 32 & 64 bit binaries (MSVG & MinGW) are provided for freeglut at
      http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
  ¤ Linux install the freeglut3 package
    When running VisualTests on a virtual Linux, if you see errors like
    https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12941 then try pre-pending
    LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 to the command-line.

Cmake configuration:
• Create a folder inside the OSS folder where you want to generate the Visual
  Studio IDE files. This folder is referred to as BUILD folder for the purpose
  of the following steps.
• Generate the OpenSurgSim solution file. Two ways to do this: using cmake gui
  or the cmake command line.
  ¤ Open CMake GUI: Enter the OSS folder, BUILD folder and click on the
    'Configure' button. This will allow you to select the compiler (VS 11, even
    though you installed “Visual Studio 2012”).
    Once the configuration is complete without error, click on the 'Generate'
    button.
    If CMake reports “library not found”, add system variables BOOST_ROOT,
    EIGEN_DIR and OSG_ROOT as environment variables. Then add %OSG_ROOT%\bin to
    your Path variable.
    If you installed GLUT as explained above, Cmake’s FindGLUT module should
    find it.
    If not, delete the cache and configure/generate again. If it still won’t
    find it on Windows, restart the computer (somehow CMake caches even when
    you delete its cache...possibly a daemon thread?). And if it still can’t
    find GLUT, you can just manually set the GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR and
    GLUT_glut_LIBRARY variables in the Cmake GUI (the library variable should
    point to glut32.lib).
  ¤ Using cmake command line: Create a cmake “cache” file with the following
    lines:
    + set(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR "path-to-eigen" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(BOOST_ROOT "path-to-boost" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    + set(OSG_DIR "path-to-osg" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
    Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you want the solution
    files to be created, and type the following command:
    cmake -C path-to-cache-file path-to-oss-source-dir

Building OpenSurgSim:
• Go to the BUILD folder and open the OpenSurgSim solution file.
• Build the ALL_BUILD project.
• For documentation, you can find it in your build directory: build\Documentation\html\index.html
• For runnable code, see the Examples folder.

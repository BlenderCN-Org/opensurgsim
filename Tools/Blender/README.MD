OpenSurgSim Blender Add-ons

To install into Blender:
1) Open Blender
2) Go to File > User Preferences (Ctrl Alt U)
3) Navigate to the 'Add-ons' tab
4) Select 'Install from File...'
5) Choose the .py file for the add-on
6) This adds it to add-on list, activate it by checking the box on the right hand side

Alternatively you can place the files into Blender's addon folder in your user directory.

Example for Linux and Blender 2.69:

```/home/$user/.blender/2.69/scripts/addons/OpenSurgSim```

Example for Windows 7 and Blender 2.69:

```C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.69\scripts\addons\OpenSurgSim```

You'll still need to activate the addon in Blender

Note: In both scenarios you can find the addon in Blender by searching for 'OpenSurgSim'
